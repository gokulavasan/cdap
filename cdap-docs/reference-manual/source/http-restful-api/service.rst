Service HTTP RESTful API
========================

.. highlight:: console

This interface supports listing all Services and making requests to the methods of an Application’s Services.
See the :ref:`http-restful-api-lifecycle` for how to control the lifecycle of Services.

Listing all Services
--------------------

You can list all Services in CDAP by issuing an HTTP GET request to the URL::

  GET <base-url>/services

The response body will contain a JSON-formatted list of the existing Services::

  [
      {
          "app": "PurchaseHistory",
          "description": "Service to lookup product ids.",
          "id": "CatalogLookup",
          "name": "CatalogLookup",
          "type": "Service"
      }
      ...
  ]

Requesting Service Methods
--------------------------
To make a request to a Service's method, send the value of the method's ``@Path`` annotation
as part of the request URL along with any additional headers, body and query parameters.

The request type is defined by the Service's method::

  <request-type> <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/services/<service-id>/methods/<endpoint-path>
  
**Note:** Any reserved or unsafe characters in the path parameters should be encoded using 
:ref:`percent-encoding <http-restful-api-conventions-reserved-unsafe-characters>`.
